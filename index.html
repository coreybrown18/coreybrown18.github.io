<P> Welcome to my Blog!  My name is Corey Brown
 and I'm a 20 year old undergrad student at the 
 University of Maine.  I'm an avid sports guy 
 and thought, why not share my passion with others.
Here, you'll be able to chat with viewers and 
post your comments about the latest news and scores. 
Enjoy! </P>
